First time cooking eggplant!

The recipe I used is adapted from [The Mediterranean Dish](https://www.themediterraneandish.com/vegetarian-stuffed-eggplant/#wprm-recipe-container-34747).

### Ingredients:

Per 4 servings.

_For the eggplant:_

* 2 eggplants
* 1/2 tablespoon salt
* 4 tablespoons olive oil
* 1.5 teaspoons cumin powder
* 1.5 teaspoons cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 1 teaspoon 21 Seasoning Saulute (from Trader Joe's)

_For the filling:_
* 1 cup couscous, cooked accordining to directions (I used Israeli couscous)
* 1 15-oz can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
* 1/2 pint cherry tomatoes, quartered
* 2 scallion stems, chopped
* handful of parsley, chopped
* 1 teaspoon chili lime seasoning
* salt, to taste
* pepper, to taste
* 1/2 cup tahini sauce, to serve (see homemade Tahini instructions in my [Hummus](https://www.whatsprernacooking.com/mediterranean/sides/vegan/hummus/) recipe)

### Instructions:

* Slice your eggplants in half and sprinkle salt over the fleshy side. Let the eggplant "sweat" for ~20-25 mins and then pat dry.

* Place eggplants on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and roast for 35-40 minutes.

* While the eggplant is roasting, make the stuffing - in a bowl, combine all the stuffing ingredients except the tahini. Mix to combine.

* When the eggplants have roasted, use a spoon to press the flesh out to create a cavity.
