Easy recipe thanks to some great Trader Joe's hacks!

### Ingredients:

_Per 1 serving:_

* 1 serving of your chosen noodles (I used Trader Joe's Wheat Noodles)
* 2-3 tablespoons sesame oil
* 1/4 package of Trader Joe's Sesame Crunch Chopped Salad Kit
* ~5oz firm tofu, drained and cubed (1/3 Trader Joe's firm tofu block)
* 2 tablespoons black bean paste (may be labeled Chunjang or Jjajang, optional)
* 1.5 tablespoons gochujang (optional)
* 1/2 tablespoon garlic
* soy sauce, to taste
* rice vinegar, to taste
* salt, to taste


### Instructions:

* Cook the noodles according to directions on the package. If you're using the Trader Joe's wheat noodles, they are pre-cooked so you're already good to go here.

* Heat your oil in a pan and add dry ingregients from the salad kit along with the tofu.

* Sauce time! Using the dressing provided in the salad kit works perfectly fine. For another option, use the black bean paste and gochujang combination.

* Add water to taste - I added ~1/2 cup of water to my sauce for my preferred consistency. Taste test and add anything else your sauce needs - soy sauce, rice vinegar, salt.

* Add the noodles and mix to incorporate.
