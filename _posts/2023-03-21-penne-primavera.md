* For your sauce, you have two options:
Option 1: you can keep it simple by adding ~1/2 cup reserved pasta water and 1/4 cup parmesan for a light sauce. Add more pasta water if needed until you get to your desired consistency. Season with salt/pepper/Italian seasoning, as preferred, and then mix with cooked pasta and garnish with some more parmesan. 
Option 2: I had some leftover alfredo sauce and pesto, which I used in this recipe. Highly recommend this combination! Add your sauces, pasta, and any additional seasonings to the pan and mix it up. Add pasta water if needed to get to your preferred consistency, and then garnish with parmesan.
