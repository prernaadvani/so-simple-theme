The hardest thing about this recipe is grating the zucchini, so anyone can make this with ease!

The recipe that I used is adapted from [Feel Good Foodie](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/zucchini-fritters/#wprm-recipe-container-25172).

### Ingredients:

_Per 6 fritters:_ 

* 2 zucchinis, grated
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 large egg
* 1/2 cup all purpose flour
* 1/2 cup grated parmesan 
* 1 teaspoon onion powder
* 1 teaspoon Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute
* 1/2 teaspoon dried cilantro or small handful of fresh cilantro
* pepper, to taste
* 2-3 tablespoons olive or avocado oil, for cooking
* 1/4 cup panko/breadcrumbs
* 1 cup tzatziki, for serving (recipe available [here](https://prernaadvani.github.io/mediterranean/sides/tzatziki/))



### Instructions:

* Place your shredded zucchini in a kitchen towel and sprinkle the salt over the zucchini. Let it sit for ~10 minutes, and then squeeze out as much liquid as possible using the kitchen towel.

* Transfer the zucchini to a small mixing bowl, and then add the egg, flour, parmesan, and seasonings. Mix until well incorporated.

* Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet. Divide the zucchini mixture into 6 equal parts and begin shaping one of them into a circle or oval. Dust the top and bottom with breadcrumbs and then set on the oil to cook. Repeat with the remaining 5 parts of zucchini mixture and cook all of them until golden brown on the bottom. Then, flip them and cook the other side.

* Once the fritters have fully cooked, place them on a layer of napkins to soak up any extra oil and prevent a greasy taste.

* Serve with tzatziki (highly recommended) or any other dip of choice.
