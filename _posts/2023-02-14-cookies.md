Happy Valentine's Day :)

First time in my 23 years baking cookies from scratch! 

The recipe I used is adapted from [Displaced Housewife](https://www.displacedhousewife.com/mega-vanilla-chocolate-chip-cookies/).

### Ingredients:

_Per ~10 cookies:_

* 1 cup light brown sugar
* 8 tablespoons butter, softened (I used Earth Balance for a dairy free alternative)
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 egg
* 1.5 tablespoons vanilla extract
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* ~1 teaspoon salt
* 1.5 cup all purpose flour
* 1 cup chocolate chips or chunks (I used dairy free dark chocolate chips)

### Instructions:

* Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

* In a mixing bowl, combine the light brown sugar and butter. If your butter is coming straight from the fridge, microwaving for ~15 seconds should soften it just enough.

* Add the olive oil, egg, and vanilla extract, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix to incorporate.

* Fold in the flour until fully incorporated, and then add the chocolate chips.

* Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Disperse large spoonfuls of cookie batter throughout the baking sheet.

* Note: My cookies in this batch did not have enough space between them and came out of the oven looking more like one large cookie rather than individual cookies. If you would like a nice round cookie shape, I would suggest using two baking sheets.

* Bake for ~15-20 minutes, and then allow to cool for at least 10 minutes.
