One of my favorite north Indian dishes!

I used my mother's recipe - thanks, mom!

### Ingredients:

_Per 4-5 servings:_

* 1/2 cup black lentils, soaked overnight
* 1/2 cup kidney beans, soaked overnight
* 2 tablespoons ghee
* 1 tablespoon minced ginger
* 1 tablespoon minced garlic
* 1 teaspoon full cumin seeds
* 1 medium finely chopped yellow onion
* 2 medium tomatoes, chopped
* 2 tablespoons tomato sauce or 1.5 tablespoons tomato paste
* 1.5 tablespoons coriander powder
* 1 teaspoon turmeric
* 1 teaspoon garam masala
* 1 teaspoon fenugreek powder
* salt, to taste
* 2 tablespoons cream or handful of chopped cilantro, as garnish (optional)




### Instructions:

* Drain and rinse the lentils + beans post-soak. Combine and place in a pot with 3x as much water as lentils and set to medium-high heat. Once the water comes to a boil, reduce heat and simmer covered for 60-70 minutes until lentils are completely tender, adding more water if necessary. Drain and set aside.

* In a pan, add ghee. Add ginger, garlic, and cumin seeds. Mix for a minute or two.

* When the garlic turns light brown, add chopped onion and saute until the onion turns translucent. 

* Add the tomatoes, tomato sauce/paste, coriander powder, turmeric, and garam masala. Saute for a minute or two. 

* Add 1 cup water. Cover and cook for 3 -4 mins. 

* Add the lentil + beans to the onion-tomato mixture. Add some more water for desired consistency and test for salt. 

* Add the fenugreek powder. 

* Cover and let it boil for 4-5 mins on medium heat. 

* Remove from heat and add garnishes, if using. 

* Enjoy!
