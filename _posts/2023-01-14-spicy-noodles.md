10 minute noodle variation #1

### Ingredients:

Per serving:

* 1 serving of your chosen noodles (I used ramen)
* 1-2 scallions, chopped
* 1 garlic clove, minced
* 1 teaspoon sesame seeds (I used Everything but the Bagel seasoning in this iteration since I was out of sesame seeds, both work fine)
* chili flakes, to taste (only if you, unlike me, have a very high spice tolerance)
* 2 tablespoons sesame oil
* 1.5 tablespoons gochujang
* 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon miso paste or powder (I used the powdered form)


### Instructions:

* Cook the noodles according to directions on the package. Drain and set aside.

* In a bowl, add the scallions, garlic, sesame seeds, and chili flakes (if using). Pour your hot sesame oil over it and give it a mix.

* Add your gochujang, rice vinegar, soy sauce, and miso paste. Give it another good stir.
