Top culinary duo: spinach and feta.

The recipe that I used is adapted from [Feel Good Foodie](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/spanakopita-triangles/#wprm-recipe-container-28543).

### Ingredients:

_Per ~40 spanakopitas:_

* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1/2 red onion, diced
* 1.5 tablespoons minced garlic
* 16 oz frozen spinach, defrosted 
* 1/2 cup parsley, chopped
* 1/2 cup scallions, chopped
* 1.5 cups feta, crumbled
* salt, to taste
* pepper, to taste
* 1 sleeve phyllo dough, defrosted (I used [this](https://athensfoods.com/products/phyllo-dough-sheets/) one)
* 1/2 cup melted butter

### Instructions:

* Heat oil in a pot and add your red onions.

* Cook for a few minutes and then add the garlic. Cook for a few more minutes, stirring frequently, until onions caramelize.

* Drain as much water as you can out of your defrosted spinach and add to the pot. Give it a good stir and remove pot from heat. 

* Add the parsley, scallions, feta, salt, and pepper. Mix until well combined.

* Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

* Roll out your phyllo dough and divide into 3 parts lengthwise using a pizza cutter or knife. Cover 2 of the parts with a damp towel (phyllo dough dries up quickly), working with one part at a time.

* On a clean surface, lay out one layer of dough. Brush it lightly with butter and place a second sheet on top of that. Lightly brush with butter again.

* Add a spoonful of spinach/feta mixture to a corner.

* Fold down again.

* Repeat the process, folding down across and down, until you have a little triangle.

* Move to a flat baking sheet lined with parchment paper and cover with a damp towel to prevent it from drying out. 

* Pro tip: I like to do 3 triangles at a time for time efficiency.

* Bake for 20-25 minutes until golden brown (I did it in batches of 12 spanakopitas at a time).

* Wait a few minutes for it to cool and then serve!

* Enjoy!
