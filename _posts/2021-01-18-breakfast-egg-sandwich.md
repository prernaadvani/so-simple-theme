Basically avocado toast with some eggs and presented as a sandwich. Sneaky, I know.


### Ingredients:

_Per 1 sandwich:_

* 1 egg (I use [pasture-raised eggs](https://www.kroger.com/p/vital-farms-alfresco-pasture-raised-grade-a-large-eggs/0086174500001) for their bright orange egg yolk colors and better nutritional qualities)
* salt, to taste
* pepper, to taste
* 2 slices of bread, toasted to desired level (I used whole wheat)
* 1/2 avocado
* 1 teaspoon Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute 
* 1 teaspoon Dash's Southwest Chipotle seasoning blend
* 1 tablespoon sauce of choice: I rotate between sriracha mayo, chipotle aioli, and pepita salsa, but you can use any other preferred topping too. 


### Instructions:

* Scramble your egg! In a small bowl, crack the egg and season with salt and pepper. Cook to preferred scrambled egg consistency. (Note: I scrambled 2 eggs in the images below because I like eating a scrambled egg by itself, which is why the quantity is different from what you will have from 1 egg).

* Mash your avocado and spread it over one side of your toasted bread slice. Top it with the 21 Seasoning Salute and the Southwest Chipotle seasonings.
