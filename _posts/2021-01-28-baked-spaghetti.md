Add one more step to your normal spaghetti routine for a casserole-like dish!

### Ingredients:

_Per 4-5 servings:_

* 1/2 lb thin spaghetti (1/2 of a standard box) or other similar pasta of choice
* 1 tablespoon butter
* 1 bell pepper, diced or cut lengthwise
* 4 oz baby spinach, chopped
* 2.5 cups marinara sauce
* 1 cup shredded mozzarella, divided
* 1/4 cup ricotta (optional, I personally like this combination of cheese)
* 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
* fresh basil, as garnish


### Instructions:

* Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

* Cook the spaghetti according to al dente instructions on the package.

* Melt the butter in a pot, and then add the bell peppers. Cook for a few minutes until softened, and then add the spinach to wilt.

* Add the marinara sauce and ricotta to the vegetables along with the cooked spaghetti. Mix, and remove from heat.

* Lightly grease an 8x8 dish and transfer 1/2 of the spaghetti to it. Layer with 1/2 cup mozzarella, followed by the rest of the spaghetti and the rest of the mozzarella. Top with the italian seasoning.

* Bake in the oven for ~15-20 minutes, until the cheese has melted. Garnish with fresh basil and enjoy!
