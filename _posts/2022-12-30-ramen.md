Gotten some heat for using cilantro but I promise, it works!

### Ingredients:

_Makes 1 serving:_

* 2 cups broth of choice (I typically use chicken, but have also used vegetable and miso previously)
* 1 package dry ramen
* small block of silken tofu, cut into pieces 
* 1 teaspoon umami seasoning blend of choice (I use the Trader Joe's Mushroom & Company multipurpose umami seasoning blend)
* salt, to taste (though I suspect you will only need to add salt if your broth is low sodium)
* pepper, to taste
* ~2 spring onion stems, plus some extra for garnish
* small bunch of cilantro, plus some extra for garnish
* 1 boiled egg (optional)


### Instructions:

* Heat your broth in a pot. Add all of your ingredients except the egg, stirring occasionally for around 10 minutes or until noodles are cooked.

* Transfer to a bowl. Add your boiled egg (if using) and garnish with some more spring onion and cilantro. Enjoy!
