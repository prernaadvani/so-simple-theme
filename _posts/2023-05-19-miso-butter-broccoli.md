My roommate made this!

The recipe it adapted from [NYT Cooking](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023496-miso-butter-roasted-broccoli).

### Ingredients:

Per 4 servings:

* 1/2 large head broccoli (about 1 to 1.5 lbs), florets and tender stems cut into bite-size pieces
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* salt, to taste
* 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
* 1/2 tablespoon white miso powder

### Instructions:

* Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

* Toss broccoli in oil and salt.

* Lightly grease a baking sheet and transfer broccoli over. Roast for 15-20 minutes until it is easily pierced with a fork.

* While broccoli is roasting, combine the butter and miso in a small bowl. When broccoli is roasted, toss in miso-butter mixture. Add more salt if needed.

* Enjoy!
