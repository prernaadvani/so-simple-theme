* Once 14 minutes are up, place the eggs in an ice bath immediately and let them cool completely.

* When cooled, peel them and slice in half.

* In a bowl, mash the egg yolks until smooth. Then, combine with the mayonnaise mixture.

* You can then either spoon the mixture into the hollow part of the eggs or pipe them in.

* Finish by garnishing with paprika and enjoy!
