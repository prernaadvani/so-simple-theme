Hardest part about this recipe is flipping the omelette (if you have tips please email me).

### Ingredients:

_Per 2 omlettes:_

* 1 cup egg whites
* Handful of chopped baby spinach
* Handful of chopped bell peppers (about 1/2 cup, red and green)
* 1/4 cup cheese (I used vegan colby jack)
* 1 teaspoon Trader Joe's Chili lime seasoning 
* salt, to taste (note: the chili lime seasoning has some salt in it, so I recommend no additional salt but you can add some extra to taste)
* pepper, to taste
* handful of chopped cilantro or 1/2 teaspoon dried cilantro 

### Instructions:

* Combine all of the ingredients in a mixing bowl.

* Lightly grease a pan and set to medium heat.

* Add ~1/2 of the mixture and cook until the bottom side solidifies and turns a slightly light brown.

* Flip the omelette (good luck, my friends.)

* When the bottom has cooked, fold inwards (burrito-ish shape). I like eating it with some more chili lime seasoning on top and with 1/2 avocado seasoned with Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute seasoning blend on the side.

* Enjoy!
