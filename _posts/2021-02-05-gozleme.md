Like Spanakopita, but with bread. 

The recipe that I used is adapted from [Cook Republic](https://www.cookrepublic.com/homemade-spinach-and-feta-gozleme/).

### Ingredients:

Per 6 gozleme-

_For the dough:_

* 2 cups all-purpose flour (plus some extra for dusting)
* 3 tablespoons greek yogurt
* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon dry yeast
* 1/2 teaspoon sea salt 
* 1/2 cup warm water 
* 2 tablespoons olive oil

_For the filling:_

* 2 cups baby spinach, chopped
* 1 cup crumbled feta
* chilli flakes (optional)
* olive oil, for pan frying
* 1 cup tzatziki, for serving (recipe available [here](https://www.whatsprernacooking.com/mediterranean/sides/tzatziki/))
  - alternatively, you can serve with lemon wedges



### Instructions:

* In a small-medium bowl, add all of the ingredients for the dough except the oil. Mix to combine.

* Lightly flour a clean surface and move the dough there. Knead for several minutes until the dough is smooth with no cellulite. It may still be a little sticky but should not be unmanageable.

* Lightly grease a bowl with olive oil and move the dough there. Flip the dough to make sure the oil covers the whole dough. Cover with a towel and let it rise for 1 hour in a warm area. For the warm area, you can put it by a window if itâ€™s sunny out. Alternatively, you can preheat the oven to 200 degrees, turn it off once it preheats, put the mixing bowl with the dough in there, and leave the oven door slightly open.

* After the dough has doubled in size, deflate and reshape into a ball. Add the olive oil and knead to incorporate it completely. Cover with a towel and let it rise in a warm place for another 30 minutes.

* Lightly flour a clean surface and move the dough there. Divide into 6 equal parts.

* Dust one of the dough parts with flour and roll it into an extremely thin rectangle - when you place your hand under the it, you should be able to see through the dough. 

* Add a small handful of spinach, feta, and chilli flakes to the center of the dough. Be careful not to overfill - you should have 4-5x more dough to fold over than the amount of filling being used.

* Fold the ends into the center to enclose the filling.

* Brush the seams with water and pinch to steal the dough.

* Dust it with flour and carefully roll it into 2-3x its size.

* Grease a nonstick pan with olive oil and pan fry the gozleme on each side for a couple of minutes until golden.
