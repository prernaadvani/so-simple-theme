The recipe I used is adapted from [Feel Good Foodie](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/baked-feta-pasta/#wprm-recipe-container-31658).

### Ingredients:

_Per 3-4 servings:_

* 1/2 lb penne (or other pasta of choice)
* 3 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 zucchini, cubed
* 1 shallot, chopped
* 1 pint cherry tomatoes
* 1 8-oz block feta
* 2 teaspoons minced garlic
* handful of spinach
* a few basil leaves, chopped
* salt, to taste
* pepper, to taste
* parmesan, as garnish


### Instructions:

* Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

* Cook pasta according to instructions and reserve ~1/2 cup of pasta water before draining.

* In an 8x8 or larger oven dish, add your olive oil, zucchini, shallot, and tomatoes. Mix around to coat everything with olive oil. Add your feta block to the center and flip once to ensure it is fully coated in olive oil as well.

* Mix everything well to make a sauce. You may need to pierce your tomatoes if they did not burst in the oven. 

* Add your garlic, spinach, and basil to the sauce. Mix until spinach has mostly wilted.
