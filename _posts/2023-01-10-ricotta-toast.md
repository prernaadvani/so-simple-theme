Like eating an integrated cheese board in one bite. Bread, fruit, cheese - you've got it all.

The recipe that I used is adapted from [Moribyan](https://moribyan.com/whipped-ricotta/).

### Ingredients:

_Per ~2 servings:_

* 1/4 baguette (or ~6 slices)
* 4 oz ricotta
* 1 tablespoon honey
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 3 tablespoons strawberry preserves (feel free to substitute with your favorite jam)
* black pepper, as garnish

### Instructions:

* Start by toasting your baguette.

* Spread a layer of strawberry preserves/jam as a base.

* In a blender, combine ricotta, honey, and olive oil. Blend until smooth and fully incorporated. Add a spoonful of ricotta mix onto each slice of bread.
