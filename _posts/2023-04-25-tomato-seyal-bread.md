Another Sindhi delicacy (my Indian sub-cultural group).

Sharing my mother's recipe - thanks, mom! 

### Ingredients:

Per ~2-3 servings:

* 6 slices of tough bread, cut into quarters with edges cut off (we use Tuscan Pane)
* 3 medium tomatoes, peeled
* 1 inch piece of ginger, roughly chopped
* 1 medium green chili
* 1 tablespoon oil
* 1 tablespoon tomato paste 
* 1 teaspoon coriander powder
* 1/2 teaspoon turmeric 
* salt, to taste

For tempering:
* 1 tablespoon oil
* 1 teaspoon fine mustard seeds
* 1 twig of curry leaves (6 to 8 leaves)
* 1/2 tsp asafoetida

### Instructions:

* In a mixer, blend tomatoes, ginger, and green chili.

* In deep edged pan, heat your oil. Add the tomato mixture, tomato paste, turmeric, coriander powder, and salt. 

* Saute on low heat.

* Add 1.5 cups of water to the pan and mix to incorporate. Cover and let it boil for 5-6 mins on medium heat. 

* Lower heat back to a simmer and add the bread. Soak the bread entirely, but avoid mixing too hard to prevent the bread from becoming mushy. Remove from heat.

* In the smallest pan you have, add all the ingredients for the tempering and cover for a few minutes while the seeds cook. 

* Pour tempering over the tomato bread and mix to incorporate.

* Enjoy!
