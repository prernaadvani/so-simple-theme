I don't really know how to describe this.

### Ingredients:

Per serving:

* 3-4 garlic confit cloves
* 1 serving of your chosen noodles (I used ramen)
* 2 scallions, chopped
* pepper, to taste
* 2 tablespoons hot sesame oil
* 1 tablespoon gochujang
* 1/2 tablespoon rice vinegar
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce
* 1/4 cup grated parmesan, plus extra as garnish


### Instructions:

* For garlic confit - preheat oven to 350 degrees. Peel garlic cloves and place them in an oven safe container. Submerge the cloves in olive oil and roast in the oven for ~45 minutes. Pro tip: they have a decent shelf in the fridge so I like to use 2 garlic heads at a time with ~1 cup olive oil and reserve the rest of the cloves for other uses.

* Cook the noodles according to directions on the package. Drain and set aside after reserving 2 cups of the water.

* In a bowl, add the scallions and pepper. Pour your hot sesame oil over it and give it a mix.

* Add your gochujang, rice vinegar, and soy sauce. Give it another good stir.

* Using a fork, break apart the garlic cloves and mix into the sauce until fully incorporated.

* Add your noodles and parmesan to the sauce and stir to combine. Add reserved noodle water - feel free to adjust quantity of water to your preferred noodle soup consistency.

* Garnish with some more parmesan and pepper. Enjoy!
