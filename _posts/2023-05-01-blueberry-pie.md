First time making pie!

The recipe that I used is adapted from [NYT Cooking](https://www.cookwithmanali.com/rice-kheer/](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/9290-blueberry-lattice-pie)).

### Ingredients:

_Per pie:_

* 2 frozen pie crusts/shells (I used [this](https://www.instacart.com/store/fairway/products/26366) one)
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 2 pints blueberries
* 2 tablespoons lemon juice
* 3 tablespoons corn starch


### Instructions:

* Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

* In a mixing bowl, combine all the pie filling ingredients.

* Transfer pie filling into one of the pie shells.

* Cut the second pie shell into 1-inch wide strips and drape across pie. Seal, trim, and crimp the edges.

* Bake for 30 mins at 400 degrees. Reduce temperature to 325 degrees and bake for another 20-30 minutes.

* Serve once cooled. Enjoy!
