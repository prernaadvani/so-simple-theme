New fun easy salad!

The recipe that I used is adapted from [Once Upon A Chef](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/corn-zucchini-tomatoes-with-goat-cheese.html#tabbox)

### Ingredients:

_Makes ~4-5 servings:_

* 1 tablespoon avocado or olive oil
* 1 shallot, minced
* 1 green bell pepper, diced
* 1 7-oz can Mexicorn, drained and rinsed
* 1 zucchini, diced
* 1 medium-large tomato, diced/minced
* 3.5 oz Miyoko's Creamery double cream garlic and herb cheese ([link, available at whole foods](https://miyokos.com/products/garlic-herb-cheese))(non vegans - substitute with 1 small log goat cheese)
* 3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
* 3/4 teaspoon sugar
* salt, to taste
* pepper, to taste
* 2 oz chopped baby spinach (to serve, optional)

### Instructions:

* Heat the oil in a small-medium pot and add the shallots. Let them cook for about a minute.

* I like to chill the salad and serve cold on a bed of chopped baby spinach. Enjoy!
