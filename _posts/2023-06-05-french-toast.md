Classic breakfast or brunch dish!

The recipe I used is adapted from [NYT Cooking](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016408-french-toast-amandine).

### Ingredients:

_Per 5-6 servings:_

* 7 eggs
* 1/2 cup soy milk
* 2 tablespoons white sugar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 8 thick slices of brioche or challah
* butter, for cooking
* fruit, maple syrup, or nuts, for serving (optional)


### Instructions:

* In a small bowl, combine eggs, milk, sugar, and vanilla extract. Whisk until you have a smooth consistency.

* Submerge each slice of bread in the liquid mix and place in a wide + flat pan. Pour the excess liquid over the bread. Let it soak for 20-30 minutes.
