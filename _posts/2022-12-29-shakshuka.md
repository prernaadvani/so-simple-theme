Coming back to this website after a long hiatus with this gem!

I have iterated this recipe a few times and love to make it for my annual galentines day brunch with some pita [(link to my recipe)](https://www.whatsprernacooking.com/mediterranean/bread/sides/vegan/pita/)

### Ingredients:

_Makes ~4 servings:_

* 2 tablespoons avocado or olive oil
* 1 white onion, minced
* 1 small green bell pepper, diced
* 1 small red bell pepper, diced
* 1 tablespoon minced garlic
* 2 teaspoons paprika
* 2 teaspoons cumin
* chili powder/chili flakes (optional, to taste)
* salt, to taste
* pepper, to taste
* 1 28-oz can of diced or crushed tomatoes
* 2 cups marinara sauce
* 4-8 eggs (per preferences)
* cilantro, for garnish
* feta, for garnish

* Four 8x8 pans or oour 9 inch circular pans or one 9x13 pan


### Instructions:

* Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

* Heat the oil in a small-medium pot and add the onions and bell peppers. Let them cook for a few minutes. 

* Add in the galic as well as all of the spices, and cook for another few minutes. 

* Pour in the entire can of diced/crushed tomatoes (liquid included) along with the marinara sauce. Bring it to a soft boil and then turn the heat down to a simmer.

* Some subjectivity on how long to keep it at a simmer - you can be good to go in anywhere from 10-30 minutes. I like a thicker consistency and simmer for the full 30 minutes.

* Transfer to 4 dishes or one 9x13 dish. Using the back of a spoon, make wells in the sauce and crack eggs directly into them. I used 4 dishes and cracked 2 eggs into each dish. 

* Add some salt and pepper on top of the eggs and bake for 8-12 minutes, depending on when your egg whites look somewhat cooked. 

* Garnish with cilantro and feta, if using, and serve with your choice of bread! I like pita or ciabatta. Enjoy!
