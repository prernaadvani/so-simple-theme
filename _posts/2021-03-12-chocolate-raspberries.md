My preferred berries over strawberries due to an ideal chocolate:berry ratio, but feel free to swap with your preferred fruit!


### Ingredients:

Makes about 1 pint raspberries-

* 3/4 cup heavy cream
* 8 oz semisweet chocolate
* 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1 pint raspberries

### Instructions:

* Microwave the heavy cream for ~60 seconds until hot. Add the chocolate and butter, and let it fit for a minute or two to melt. Whisk to combine and then add the vanilla extract.
