I used to think all oats tasted like cardboard until I tried steel cut!

### Ingredients:

_Per 1-2 servings:_

* 1/2 cup instant steel cut oats from Trader Joe's
* 3/4 cup milk (sub dairy free)
* Toppings of choice (fresh fruit, dried fruit, nuts, honey/maple syrup - choose your own adventure! I used 1/2 cup blueberries in this recipe).

### Instructions:

* Combine 3/4 cup water and 3/4 cup milk in a pot and bring to a boil. Add your oats and turn your heat to low. Cook for 7-10 minutes until it reaches your desired consistency, stirring frequently. Transfer to a bowl.
