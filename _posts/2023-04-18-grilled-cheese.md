Inspired by the grilled cheese offered by my favorite cafe back in Dallas!

PS: If you ever find yourself in Dallas craving a grilled cheese, [Cafe Brazil](https://www.cafebrazil.com) is the place to go.

### Ingredients:

_Per sandwich:_

* 2 slices of toast or 1 roll (I used Tuscan Pane in this recipe, but Ciabatta rolls also work great)
* 2 slices cheddar cheese
* Handful of mozzarella
* Handful of feta
* 1 tablespoon butter

_Note: tastes great served with some tomato soup!_


### Instructions:

* Assemble your sandwich by adding all the cheeses between your bread.

* Add the butter to a pan and once melted, place your sandwich on it.

* Once the cheese begins melting and your bottom slice of bread is nice and toasted, flip over and toast the other side.

* Remove from heat, cut sandwich in half, and enjoy with some tomato soup or by itself!
