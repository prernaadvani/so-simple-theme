A popular street food that also makes a quick and easy breakfast dish.

The recipe that I used is adapted from [Wandercooks]([https://www.onceuponachef.com/how-to/pizza-dough-recipe.html](https://www.wandercooks.com/vietnamese-pizza-banh-trang-nuong/#recipe)).

### Ingredients:

Per pizza.

_For the dough:_

* 1 rice paper
* 1 egg
* 1/2 teaspoon Trade Joe's Chili Lime seasoning (sub chili flakes or other seasoning of choice)
* 1 scallion, chopped
* 1 tablespoon sriracha mayo (sub hot sauce or other sauce of choice)

### Instructions:

* Lightly gease a pan and set to low heat for a few minutes. When the pan is heated, place down your rice paper.

* Crack an egg in the center and using one chopstick, gently scramble and spread evenly across the rice paper.

* Sprinkle your chili seasoning across the egg and then add your scallion and sriracha mayo.

* Cook for a few minutes until the rice paper is crisp and your egg is fully cooked. I like to fold mine in half (optional).

* Transfer to a plate and enjoy!
