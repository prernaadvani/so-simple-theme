Yet another fabulous way to eat noodles.

The recipe I used is adapted from [Korean Bapsang](https://www.koreanbapsang.com/jajangmyeon-noodles-in-black-bean-sauce/).

### Ingredients:

_Per 2 servings:_

* 2 serving of your chosen noodles (I used thin udon)
* 1 zucchini, diced
* 3 tablespoons black bean paste (may be labeled Chunjang or Jjajang)
* sugar, to taste
* soy sauce, to taste
* rice vinegar, to taste
* 1/2 cup broth/stock of choice (optional)
* 1-2 scallions, chopped (as garnish)


### Instructions:

* Cook the noodles according to directions on the package. Drain and set aside.

* Heat your oil in a pan and add zucchini, cooking for a few minutes until softened.

* Add your black bean paste mix to combine. Since every paste tastes a little different, give it a try and add sugar/soy sauce/rice vinegar as desired. 

* Add enough broth/stock or water to the sauce per your preferred liquidity level.
