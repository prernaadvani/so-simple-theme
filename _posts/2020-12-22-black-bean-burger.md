My friend Jay eats a vegan version of this for at least 4 meals per week. 


### Ingredients:

_Per 4 burger patties:_

* 1 15.5-oz can of black beans, drained and rinsed (I like using cuban style black beans from Trader Joe's since they come with some peppers mixed with the beans)
* 1/2 cup of cooked rice (you can use short grain, long grain, basmati, brown rice, or substitute with quinoa - they all work well)
* 1 cup corn, drained and rinsed if using canned (I like using Mexicorn for the added peppers, available at [Kroger](https://www.kroger.com/p/green-giant-mexicorn/0002000010453))
* 1 large egg
* 1/2 cup panko or breadcrumbs (plus another optional 1/4 cup for a crispier outer layer)
* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1/2 teaspoon chilli powder
* pinch of cayenne 
* 1 teaspoon "everything but the elote" seasoning from Trader Joe's (optional)
* salt, to taste
* pepper, to taste
* 2 tablespoons olive or avocado oil, for cooking
  
_Per 4 burgers:_

* 4 "everything but the bagel" ciabatta rolls, available at [Trader Joe's](https://www.traderjoes.com/digin/post/everything-ciabatta-rolls) (substitute with other bread as desired, this one is just my favorite)
* 1 cup guacamole, recipe available [here](https://prernaadvani.github.io/sides/vegan/mexican/guacamole/)
* 4 slices of cheese (I personally like pepper jack in this recipe, and sometimes I substitute it with feta or goat cheese)
* 4 tablespoons chipotle aioli (optional, I like using [this one](https://www.kroger.com/p/kraft-chipotle-aioli/0002100006499))
* 8 large tomato slices (optional)


### Instructions:

* In a large mixing bowl, mix the beans, rice, corn, egg, 1/2 cup breadcrumbs, and seasoning. Using a potato masher, mash until mostly smooth with the occasional half-mashed bean. Divide mixture into 4 equal parts.

* Using your hands, shape each of the four parts into the shape of a burger patty. To make the outer layer crispier, dust the top and bottom of each patty with some panko/breadcrumbs. 

* If you're making this ahead of time, wrap each burger patty individually in plastic wrap and refrigerate or freeze.

* When you're ready to cook, toast your burger bun to desired level, heat 1/2 tablespoon avocado or olive oil to a small pan, and add one burger patty. Cook for a few minutes until the outer layer has firmed well, and then flip. Add a slice of cheese to the cooked side, and let the other side cook for a few minutes. When cooked, take off heat and place the patty on top of one side of the burger bun. Repeat this 3 more times for your other three patties, or you can add 2 tablespoons of oil to a large pan and cook all four patties simultaneously.

* To the other side of your burger bun, add 1/4 cup guacamole, chipotle aioli (if using) and tomato slices (if using). If you're using feta or goat cheese, sprinkle it on top. Close the burger bun, slice in half, and enjoy!
