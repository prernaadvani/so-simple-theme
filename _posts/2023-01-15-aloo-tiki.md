Adding to the potato repertoire on this website.

Sharing my mother's recipe - thanks, mom!

### Ingredients:

_Per 9 mini pancakes:_

* 3 medium russet potatoes
* 2 teaspoons whole cumin
* 3 green chilies, finely chopped
* Handful of fresh cilantro, finely chopped
* Salt, to taste
* 1/2 cup plain bread crumbs
* 3 tablespoons olive oil, for cooking

### Instructions:

* Boil the potatoes - add cold water to a large pot, add the potatoes, and cook on medium heat for ~20-30 minutes until potatoes are tender. (Pro tip: they cook faster if you chop them into cubes)

* Peel your potatoes once they are cooked and using a potato masher, mash them until smooth with no potato clumps. 

* In a bowl, add the potatoes along with the rest of the ingredients except the bread crumbs and oil. Mix until incorporated. 

* Divide the mix into 9 equal parts and create flattened round balls with each part. It helps if you grease your palms with oil prior.

* Coat each pancake with bread crumbs.
