Algerian crepes that involve a tomato based filling in a crispy flatbread.

The recipe that I used is adapted from [Margo Drobi](http://margodrobi.com/2022/08/17/vegan-mahjouba/#wpzoom-recipe-card).

### Ingredients:

Per 8 small crepes-

_For the dough:_

* 1.5 cups all purpose flour
* 1.5 cups fine semolina
* 1 teaspoon salt
* ~1.25 cups water

_For the filling:_

* 2 tablespoons avocado or olive oil, plus extra for pan frying and to coat the dough
* 1 large white onion, diced
* 1 red bell pepper, diced
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 2 cups tomato puree
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 1 teaspoon cumin powder
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 1 teaspoon harissa seasoning
* salt, to taste
* pepper, to taste
* handful of parsley

* 1 cup tzatziki, for serving (recipe available [here](https://www.whatsprernacooking.com/mediterranean/sides/tzatziki/))



### Instructions:

* In a small-medium bowl, add all of the dry ingredients for the dough. Mix and slowly add water until your dough can hold a round shape without difficulty - you may have to adjust the water quantity. Cover the dough and set aside.

* Heat oil in a pan and add your onion, bell pepper, and garlic. Cook for a few minutes until they soften.

* Add the tomato paste, tomato puree, and all of your seasonings. Mix to combine and let it cook for a few more minutes until you achieve a thick consistency. Then, add the parsley, cook for another minute or two, and transfer to a bowl.

* Return to your dough. Lightly grease a clean surface and move the dough there. Divide into 8 equal parts.

* Lightly grease one of the dough parts with oil and roll it into an thin layer.

* Add a heaping spoonful of filling to the center of the dough. Be careful not to overfill - you should have 4-5x more dough to fold over than the amount of filling being used.

* Fold the ends into the center to enclose the filling.

* Brush the seams with water and pinch to steal the dough.

* Grease a nonstick pan with olive oil and pan fry the crepes on each side for a couple of minutes until golden.
