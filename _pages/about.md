Hello,

My name is Prerna and I am a recent graduate of Emory Universty, where I studied Quantitative Sciences, Sociology, and Dance. In an attempt to combine two of my favorite things, food and code, I decided to build a recipe website with some of the doos that I am enjoying making. By no means am I claiming to be a culinary professional - I am really quite a novice, and this is more of a pet project to hone in some programming skills and share what I've been up to.

Thank you for visiting this page, and please let me know if you try any of the recipes on here, if you have any feedback or comments, or if you have any recommendations for new recipes - I'm always excited to try different things!

_Note: if you see a 404 error when you try to click on any links, it may be because I am updating the page. However, if you receive this error for longer than 24 hours, please let me know and I will fix it!_


Enjoy!
